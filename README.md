# book-search-engine

## Description

I worked on this project in order to help avid book readers search for new books and keep a list of books to purchase. This app saves the user the trouble of having to go on multiple websites to look at books and stay organized with a Saved Books list. While working on this app, I learned how to refactor a fully functioning app with a RESTful API into a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server. Although it was challenging, I became a lot more comfortable working with typeDefs and resolvers.

## Usage

The user will first be presented with the homepage where they can search for books. Once they type in a name of a book in the search bar and click "Submit Search", they will be shown information about that book. If the user wishes to save books, they must either login or sign up. To sign up, the user will be required to enter a username, email, and password. Once signed in, they should see an additional tab for Saved Books. When the user is logged in and searching for books, they can access a button where they can save books to their list. To view their saved selections, they can click on the Saved Books tab. The user will also see the logout tab, when they are ready to logout.
